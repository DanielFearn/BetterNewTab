# BetterNewTab

I'm going to be working on this project in my spare time. The idea is this: a page with a custom wallpaper and buttons that can open a single or multiple tabs. For example, if you always open your personal email, work email and GitHub, you can create a single button to do that. New buttons can be added by entering the details into some prompts. Everything will be stored in localstorage and the whole thing will be built in JS.

All constructive criticism gratefully accepted!
